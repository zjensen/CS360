		<h1>About me!</h1>
		<pre>
			I was born in Boca Raton, Florida, in 1994. From the ages of 2 to 18 I lived in San Diego, before moving to Provo Utah, to attend BYU where I now reside.
		I do not really know what else to write . . . 
		I am getting married this week which is pretty cool, I have a beard-card, and I work for Learning Suite as a web developer.
